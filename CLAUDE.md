# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

```bash
node build-lessons.js   # Generates lesson-one.html through lesson-compound.html
node build-fluency.js   # Generates fluency-l1.html through fluency-l5.html
```

No test or lint tooling is configured.

## Architecture

This is a **static educational web app** for teaching mathematical relationship naming. All output files are auto-generated — never edit them directly.

### Generation Pipeline

```
lesson-template.html + lesson-config.json + lesson-N-specific.js
  → build-lessons.js → lesson-one.html ... lesson-compound.html

fluency-template.html + fluency-config.json
  → build-fluency.js → fluency-l1.html ... fluency-l5.html
```

### Two App Types

**Lessons** (`lesson-*.html`) — Instructional phase. Each lesson has:
- An instruction phase (guided scenarios with audio/text)
- A practice phase (random model generation + word bank answers)

**Fluency drills** (`fluency-*.html`) — Timed drill phase. 5 levels map to lesson types: equal, partwhole, comparison, fractional, multiplicative.

**Hub** (`index.html`) — Navigation and progress overview.
**Chart** (`chart.html`) — Local-storage-based progress visualization.

### Source Files to Edit

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lesson-template.html` | Shared UI + JS engine for all lessons |
| `lesson-config.json` | Metadata per lesson (titles, storage keys, nav links) |
| `lesson-N-specific.js` | Per-lesson content: `INSTRUCT` array, generator functions, render functions |
| `fluency-template.html` | Shared UI + JS engine for all fluency drills |
| `fluency-config.json` | Metadata per fluency level |

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions auto-builds and commits generated HTML on changes to source files:
- `.github/workflows/build-lessons.yml` — triggers on template/config/specific-file changes
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` — triggers on fluency source changes

### State

All user progress is stored in **localStorage** only — no backend. Keys follow the pattern `fluency_l1_sessions`, etc., defined in `fluency-config.json`.

## Working Rules

- Never edit generated files directly (lesson-one.html through lesson-compound.html, fluency-l1.html through fluency-l5.html)
- Before making any changes, read the relevant source file first
- After making changes, document exactly what was changed
- Never make unrequested changes to existing files
- If you notice something that needs fixing beyond the request, flag it and wait for instruction
- Always run the appropriate build script after editing source files and confirm it succeeded
